                <div class="container"><p>The gender pay gap is a global issue that affects women in all job markets. One example of this is Erin, 26, an experienced engineer with a Masters degree who works five days a week, yet she is still paid significantly less than her male counterparts who are not as qualified as her and work only four days a week. Erin stated, “I asked for a raise to match the others’ day rates. I stated my case and said it was not fair and that I would leave if it was not resolved. I was nearly fobbed off with a much smaller raise but I said again that I would not take anything less than being equal to the men. My supervisor agreed reluctantly.”(Kasperkevic) This pay discrepancy is indicative of a larger issue surrounding the gender pay gap and raises the question of why women are paid less than men for doing the same job. These discrepancies have real-world implications for women in the workforce, creating an unequal playing field in terms of compensation and benefits. The Institute For Women’s Policy Research states,  “The gender wage gap has stayed essentially unchanged since 2001…If the pace of change in the annual earnings ratio continues at the same rate as it has since 1960, it will take another 45 years, until 2058, for men and women to reach parity.”(Hegewisch, Phil, and Williams) Women have been treated unfairly since entering the workforce. As a society we have been aware of the employment inequality between men and women. Companies and employers are not resolving this issue on their own. This leads womens to have to advocate for themselves in the board seats of their companies, and unfortunately only 30% of the board seats are occupied by women. This means that they are usually outnumbered in their opinions and what is heard. We must act to find a solution for the gender pay gap. Congress must pass legislation that requires all employers to be transparent on the salaries for every position within their company. Additionally, legislation should mandate a monetary penalty for any employer determined to engage in any gender pay inequality practices.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The wage gap over time has been on a decline with the gap slowly closing. Starting in the 1980's to the 1990's women started to increase their prevalence in the workforce which shot down the men's wage advantage. Men had an advantage over women in the pay distribution because women weren’t represented nearly as much as men at the top of the wage distribution due to the positions they held in their workplaces. The decrease of the men's wage advantage has started to slow down but there is still gender segregation in the workforce which contributes to the gender wage gap. With the changing structure of the wage distribution it makes it harder for women to close this gap and creates the idea that women should aim for the same jobs as men just to receive the same pay.The representation of women in the top percentile continues to rise but men rise as well on the pay scale. Overall, the wage gap between men and women has significantly decreased but has been on a slow and stagnant decline as the pay gap gets closer and closer together.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">In a world of increasing gender equality, one of the most glaring differences between the sexes remains the pay gap. This video, created by Hank Green, is significant because it sheds light on this issue by providing facts, statistics, and real-life examples that illustrate the magnitude of the gender pay gap. 

Hank Green begins by stating that the gender pay gap exists among hourly (16% pay gap), weekly (18-19% gap) and annual earners (21% gap). It also exists, but varies, in countries all around the world. However, one of the most important points that Green makes is that when the factors of skill, education, experience, and occupation are taken into account the gender pay gap shrinks to 4-8%. This 4-8% gap can’t be explained economicaly and is therefore thought to be solely based on gender discrimination. A 4-8% pay gap seems small and almost insignificant especially when we have heard pay gap percentages reported at 16 or 21 percent. However a 4-8% gap translates into women annually losing over $241,000,000 due entirely to discrimination. Green goes on to explain that choices women make also affect the pay gap that they face. He asserts that women often chose professions that pay less to begin with, like teaching and caregiving. Surprisingly even within female dominated professions the gap still exists with men making more than the women. Additionally, men disproportionately advance over women in the women dominated fields. Green also cites a study that showed that when women with children applied to jobs they were less likely to be offered a job and when they were offered a job, they were presented with lower starting salaries than the men. The idea that women dominated professions like teaching make less than typically male dominated professions like engineering, and the idea that women with children are less likely to be hired than men (even those with children) shows how the gender pay gap is deeply entrenched in societal values and the conception that traditional male roles are considered more worthy still exists. As a society we think we are fighting the preconceived idea that there is “women’s work” and “mens work”, but it seems that idea exists even though it is not blatantly observed. 

Green succinctly explores the disparities between men and women in terms of earning potential, and illustrates the vast extent to which these inequalities exist in the modern world. In doing so, the video makes clear the impact this has on women, men, and society as a whole. Green rationalizes that at the current rate the gender pay gap as we know it won’t close until at least 2058. By highlighting the global economic effects of inequality in pay, the video also demonstrates why this discrepancy must be addressed on a systemic level.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Not only is there a pay gap between men and women but also between races and ethnicities. As it is seen on the graph, Black/African-Americans and Hispanic/Latino ethnicities earn the least in comparison to the other races/ethnicities. Not only do women have to advocate for themselves to recieve equal pay, but also other indiviuals who are not white or asian. Fortunately there are groups that people can turn to to raise awareness and fight against the pay gap. A few include Equal Pay Today, National Committee on Pay Equity NCPE, and AAUW. These groups promote closing the gap and creating better, equal work environments. </p>
